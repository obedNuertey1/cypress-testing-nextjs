## Introduction
### Purpose
This technical documentation is just to demonstrate how to use Cypress for testing web application.
### Scope
In this documentation we focus on two main testing techniques used to test web application using cypress. These are; ***Component Testing*** and ***End-to-End testing***

### Audience
The documentation serves as a knowledge repository for future developers, testers, and team members who can reference it to understand the testing history, methodologies, and outcomes of using **Cypress** for software testing.

### Testing Environment
***Requirements***:
- Cypress:
  - Node.js: Cypress is a Node.js tool, so you need to have Node.js installed on your system.
  - Operating System: Cypress supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - Browser Support: Cypress primarily supports Google Chrome, but it also supports other browsers like Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox.
- Next.js:
  - Node.js: Next.js is built on top of Node.js, so you need to have Node.js installed.
  - npm or Yarn: npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js, or you can use Yarn as an alternative package manager.
  - Operating System: Next.js is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

***Environments***:
- ***Staging***:
  - Open this folder in vscode.
  - In the current directory type the following command;
	```bash
	npm install
	```
	Or
	```bash
	yarn install
	```
	To install all dependencies.
  - Type the following command install Cypress as a ***dev*** dependency: 
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```
   Or
   ```bash
   yarn install cypress --save-dev
   ```
- ***Development Environment***:
    - To use cypress for E2E testing you need to start the development environment.
    - To start the development environment you type the command 
     ```bash
	 npm run dev
     ```
	 OR
     ```bash
	 yarn run dev
     ```
	 
## Conclusion

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the testing process for [Web Application Name]. It covers various testing phases, strategies, and methodologies to ensure the application's quality and reliability. By following the guidelines outlined in this documentation, the testing team can effectively identify and rectify defects, ensuring a seamless user experience.






































This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
